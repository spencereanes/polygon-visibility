## Files
app.R contains RShiny code to run the Shiny Application.  
visibility.R contains all of the functions that do the actual computation.  
visRun.R contains code necessary to run some sample input outside of the Shiny appliation.  

## Instructions for Use
User must have R packages: 
 - Tidyverse
 - IceCast
 - SF
 - rbst (from github, instrutions in visRun.R)
 - RStudio is recommended.
 
Comments in visibility.R explain how the functions work.  
visRun.R can be run line by line for output.
